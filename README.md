## Templates

Model specific templates for motorcycle graphics.  Files include Roland style magenta cut lines and blank print areas.  See the moto-design templates [README](templates/README.md).

## SVG Generators

Programs to generate scalable vector graphics files for camouflage blobs, user defined stars, and Yamaha racing like srtipes.  See the moto-design SVG generators [README](design-aides/svg-generators/README.md).
